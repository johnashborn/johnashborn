## About Me
- I aim to build **AI-assisted applications**, especially systems designed to solve real-world problems.
- Currently a **2nd-year BSIT student** at **Bohol Island State University**.
- Built a **Lost and Found System** using **Java Swing**, [view project](https://github.com/johnashborn/Lost-And-Found).
- Built **StudyBot** using Llama.cpp, an offline AI-powered application that uses tinyLlama LLM - [view project](https://github.com/johnashborn/Studybot).
- Currently working on **Studie**, an AI-powered academic assistant built to support student learning for free — [view project](https://github.com/johnashborn/StuDie_app) (**in progress**).
- Actively improving my understanding of **databases, backend systems, AI integration, software fundamentals, and Android development**.
- If you code long enough, you'll crash out.
